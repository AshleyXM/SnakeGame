# Functionality
- Players use WASD to control the snake direction.
- Snake cannot move reversely, for example, the snake which is moving rightward will not turn into leftward by pressing A.
- There are two kinds of food for the snake: the regular food which displays as a red dot is worth 10 points, and the bonus food, which displays as a pink dot and comes up in a random interval, is worth 20 points
- Once the snake eats food, no matter which kind, it grows a body segment.
- The game is over if the snake hits the wall or bites itself.
- Once the game is over, there will be an interface displaying the final score.
- At the score display interface, press R to restart the game.
- **Advanced function**: players can toggle the moving speed by pressing key F, if the current mode is hard (moving fast), then it will switch to the normal mode (moving smoothly), and vice versa.

# Dependencies
